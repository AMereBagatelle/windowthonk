# WindowThonk

Quick mod to fix a few things that have been annoying me about Minecraft's window opening and management.

### Features
- openOnCorrectMonitor: Makes MC open on the monitor that your mouse is on, instead of the primary monitor.
- changeWindowTitle: Makes the title of the MC window be simply "Minecraft*" to allow for easy targeting of the window.
- changeWindowClass: Makes the window class be "Minecraft" for easy targetting by window manager.  Only works on Linux (possibly only X11)

### Configuration

Inside the `config/windowthonk.properties` file you can specify which things you want enabled.
All tweaks are enabled by default.
